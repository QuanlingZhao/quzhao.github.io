I am a first year PhD student at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) in Computer Science and Engineering Department. I am currently a graduate researcher at [System Energy Efficiency Lab](http://varys.ucsd.edu/), where I fortunately have been working with Prof. [Tajana Rosing](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DY_XcO4AAAAJ&hl=en). My research interests are efficient and theoretically founded machine learning algorithms applicable in practical settings. Prior to my PhD, I received my B.S. degree in Computer Science also from UCSD in 2023. Feel free to contact me via Email: quzhao@ucsd.edu
