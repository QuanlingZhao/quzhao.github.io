I am a first year PhD student at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) in Computer Science and Engineering Department. I am currently a graduate researcher at [System Energy Efficiency Lab](http://varys.ucsd.edu/), where I fortunately have been working with Prof. Tajana Rosing. My research interests are efficient and theoretically founded machine learning algorithms applicable in practical settings.
